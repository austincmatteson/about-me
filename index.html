      <h1>This site is all about me, Austin Matteson.</h1>
      <h2>A short note:</h2>
      <p>Thank you so much for your interest in my life. I was born into a mixed family. One half caucasion. The other Native American. It has been my priviledge to bear a closer resemblance to my european heritage, thus avoiding many of the prejudices that befell my mother growing up. It is because of this I hardly talk about it. But I bring it up to talk about something near to my heart. After my grandfather's passing, a great man who served on our tribal council for many years, my aunt, mother, cousin, and I made a nonprofit organization to better serve what he cared about most, native education. <a href="https://rmpfoundation.org/">Here is the site.</a> If you have the time, I would also ask you check that out too. Thank you.</p>
